# CSC 17a: C++ Programming
The application of software engineering techniques to the design and development of large programs; data abstraction, structures, and associated algorithms. A comprehensive study of the syntax and semantics of the C++ language and the methodology of Object-Oriented program development. 54 hours lecture and 18 hours laboratory


## Program Learning Outcomes

1. Analyze and understand the Object-Oriented C++ environment.
2. Demonstrate the use of specialized terminology, directives, and features of the C++ language.
3. Apply theoretical business, scientific, and mathematical concepts in writing and executing programs in the C++ language using Object-Oriented programming methodology.
4. Demonstrate  specified problem-solving skills using the C++
    language.

**Bottom Line** - At the end of the course you will need to demonstrate the ability to create 2 dimensional dynamic arrays of objects that utilize abstract, inherited, and generic programming concepts.
